    Greetings! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in <a href="http://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Data Science and Analytics</a> at HKUST(GZ), supervised by <a href="https://yuxuanliang.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Yuxuan Liang</a> and co-supervised by <a href="https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/YUE-Yang/yangyue" target="_blank">Prof. Yue Yang</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/" target="_blank">Prof. Yangqiu Song</a>. Previously, I obtained my M.Phil. degree from the same university and my B.E. degree in <a href="https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from HFUT.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
    Currently, I am collaborating closely with <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/rogerz/" target="_blank">Prof. Roger Zimmermann</a> from National University of Singapore, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sNb24gkAAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;oi=sra" target="_blank">Dr. Hao Xu</a> from Huawei, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qingsongwen8/" target="_blank">Dr. Qingsong Wen</a> from Squirrel AI. Prior to that, I interned at XPENG (supervised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheng-lu-5b24a739/" target="_blank">Dr. Cheng Lu</a>) and worked as a full-time Software Engineer at Tencent from 2022 to 2023.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
    My research focuses on Spatio-Temporal Modeling, Foundation Models, and Multimodal Time Series Analysis, I aim to build <em>lightweight</em>, <em>adaptive</em>, and <em>practical</em> spatio-temporal systems. I am passionate about translating cutting-edge research into deployable solutions that address real-world challenges.
