  <p>
  I am currently an M.Phil. student and an incoming Ph.D. student in <a href="http://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/">Data Science and Analytics</a>] at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), under the supervision of <a href="https://yuxuanliang.com/">Prof. Yuxuan Liang</a> & "<a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/">Prof. Yangqiu Song</a>. I received my B.E. from the <a href="https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/">School of Computer and Information</a> at Hefei University of Technology.
  </p>
  <p>
  My research interests focus on Multimodal Machine Learning and Data Mining, particularly in Spatio-Temporal and Urban scenarios. I aim to extract valuable insights from large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain data.
  </p>
  <p>
  Previously, I worked as an Research Intern at <a href="https://www.xpeng.com/">XPENG</a>, where I concentrated on visual multimodal research and contributed to the development of the XNGP System. I also have experience as a full-time Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.tencent.com/">Tencent</a>, where I improved QQ’s performance and developed cloud-native tools like CodeSpaces and the Workflow Engine.
